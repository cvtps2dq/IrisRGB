IRIS RGB is a custom LED Driver, which uses Java as a controller and ESP32 / Arduino as a board.

## Features

- Multiple color slideshows inside
- Sound trigger (WORK IN PROGRESS)
- DataFlow Interconnect (WORK IN PROGRESS)

IRIS RGB is a creative way to create immersion when working with sound.
For example - IRIS will glow red, when you use too much audio compression.

As cv2 said once:
> Audio is a way to express your feelings, audio is art, audio is hard work, and it's good to have assistance in process of creating it.
